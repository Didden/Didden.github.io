My name is Didrick Karlsson and I'm currently studying Development and operation of software systems at Linnaeus University in Kalmar, Sweden. I live in Oskarshamn and therefore study remotely. Computers interests me greatly which is why I decided to become a software engineer. I'm generally a quick learner which is great but the fact that I'm a terrible procrastinator kind of cancels it out, unfortunately.

I feel the need to fill out the page so the footer stays at the bottom so here's a pic of me.
