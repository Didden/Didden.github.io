I implemented comments with the use of [disqus](https://disqus.com/). It's an easy way to add comments to your site. It's available for free with ads or you can pay a monthly subscription to get it ads-free if you so choose.

It supports a number of platforms and quite recently, jekyll, which this site is built using.
