Open Graph is a technology first introduced by Facebook that gives the creator of a website more control of how the site is presented when shared on facebook. This is done by using meta tags, which points to what should be shared.

On this site I use the bare minimum of what is required. there are a ton of different meta tags.

__Here what my tags look like:__

```
  <meta property="og:title" content="My site" />
  <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
  <meta property="og:url" content="http://example.com" />
  <meta property="og:image" content="http://example.com/images/image.jpg" />
```
